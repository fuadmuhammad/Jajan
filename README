JAJAN Flow
==========

When you first run the application, Jajan will try to detect your location. Upon successful detection, Jajan will query Urbanesia for nearby Jajanans. Jajan will also query Google to reverse geocode the coordinates retrieved earlier.

To get new Jajanans, simply shake your phone and Jajan will vibrate to indicate a successful shake event.

Jajan uses Wikitude API to integrate Augmented Reality view. There is a dedicated icon on the action bar, when clicked, Jajan will try to launch Wikitude and overlay the camera view with POIs from nearby Jajanans.

Urbanesia also have places that has been photographed for Panoramic Views. If any of the nearby Jajanans contain images suited for Panoramic View, Jajan will show a special icon, when clicked, Jajan will download the images and launches Panoramic View upon successful downloads.

Urbanesia API v1.0
==================

Jajan is using data from Urbanesia API v1.0, the version commited to this repository does not have the proper authorization details yet to connect to the API. To gain access, please go to <http://wwww.urbanesia.com/auth/api_reg/> and register.

Urbanesia API v1.0 is protected using OAuth v1.0a and a client library called OAUTHnesia is available within Jajan to connect to the API. However, the library in Jajan lacks update, please do not use this for your perusal. You can find OAUTHnesia for various platforms here <https://github.com/search?q=oauthnesia>.
